## v1.0.1 - People API helpers
Gcontacts now ships as a People API helper module that wraps contact and directory operations for faster integration into Instago apps.

### Added
- Initial set of helper operations for listing, searching, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting Contacts via the People API.
- Support for otherContacts and directoryPeople endpoints so apps can work with peripheral and domain directory entries alongside the core contact list.
