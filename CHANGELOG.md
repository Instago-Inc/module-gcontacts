## v1.0.2 - Docs refresh for Google Contacts helper
The README and docs now highlight the gcontacts helper workflow, configuration, and People API usage so developers can find usage examples and env guidance faster.

### Changed
- Reworked prose across the README and docs to clarify descriptions, export lists, configuration hints, and sample calls for the Google Contacts helper.

## v1.0.1 - People API helpers
Gcontacts now ships as a People API helper module that wraps contact and directory operations for faster integration into Instago apps.

### Added
- Initial set of helper operations for listing, searching, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting Contacts via the People API.
- Support for otherContacts and directoryPeople endpoints so apps can work with peripheral and domain directory entries alongside the core contact list.
